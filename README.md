# Snake for MicroView

## Description
A snake game.

## Goal
Adapt the existing game to the new microview. (nearly done)

There is an autopilot which plays for you untill you press a button, then your game starts.
The autopilot is not very good, it will crash into itself.

connect your buttons between ground and pins 2+3, where pin 2 is the right button.

there still is a ton of debugging to do, but the game should not have any game breaking bugs anymore.

tell me if it works.

## Required Libraries
[MicroView Library](https://github.com/geekammo/MicroView-Arduino-Library/)

## Installation
copy the ino file and open it in the arduino ide. more info soon.
